            <div class="about-me-info">
                <p>I am a developer from England who works in many areas of computing, whether it be networking, security, hardware and most importantly, software.
                    I write software in a few languages, each with their own reasoning. I do Arduino for robotics, HTML + CSS + JS for web development, C# for bots 
                    and windows/graphical applications and some game development but my primary language being C/C++. I use C++ for practically anything I can, backend,
                    robotics, game and graphical applications and just about anything that it can be used for.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started programming when I was around 12-14 in C++ and been working hard on my skills ever since, spreading to new areas of computing I didn't even know 
                    existed. Since then I have decided to go for a software development career and have been doing development work all over the place;

                    <br>
                    <h3>Discord bot development</h3>
                    <br>
                    I have been developing Discord bots for a few months now and have supplied services to a total of over 15,000+ people. I have worked on Discord bots for individual servers 
                    such as <a href = "https://Discord.gg/ahhhmonkey" target = "_blank">a Discord server made by a popular TikTokker</a> and <a href = "https://discord.gg/swiss001 target = _blank">A server made by a
                    popular YouTuber</a>. My bot/features in other bots get used on average 5 times per minute in these two servers alone!. I have a custom Discord bot that you can
                     <a href = "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=733070829168099398&permissions=8&scope=bot" target = "_blank">invite here.</a> This bot can do many features from as simple as repeat a phrase
                    to guess an images contents just by looking at it. My bots are written in C# in the Discord.net API and are completley free to use.

                    <br>
                    <h3>Other things</h3>
                    <br>
                    I also study networking in my free time and server managment, in fact, this website is hosted on my own AWS T2 micro server that I set up. <br>
                    I also look around many other areas of computing such as hardware, how all of that works, computer history and data/cyber security.
