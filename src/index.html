                    <br>
                    I am a developer from England who is knowledgeable in many areas of computing, whether it be networking, security, hardware, and software.
                    I write software in a few languages, each with their own reasoning and advantages. I do Arduino for robotics, HTML + CSS + javascript for web development, C# for Discord 
                    bots and windows/graphical applications and some game development but my primary language being C/C++. I use C++ for practically anything I can, this includes: backend,
                    robotics, game and graphical applications, general console applications and just about anything that I can use it for. This is because I think it is a very neat and 
                    efficient language which has the advantage of speed, and  I truly believe that such complex languages such as C++ makes you a better programmer and teaches you propper
                    programming practices.
                        
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started programming when I was around 12-14 and started in C++ and been working hard on my skills ever since, looking into new areas of computing I didn't even know 
                    existed. But among that, I have decided to go for a software development career and have been trying to achieve this by getting as much experience as possible, so I have
                    been doing development work in many areas from Discord bots to robotics and even to game development. I've started combining my programming knowledge with other areas of
                     computing to make interesting and useful applications.

                    <br>
                    <!-- <h3>Discord bot development</h3> -->
                    <br>
                    I have been developing Discord bots for a few months now and have supplied services to a total of over 15,000+ people. I have developed Discord bots for individual servers 
                    such as <a href = "https://Discord.gg/ahhhmonkey" target = "_blank" style="font-size:.8vw">a Discord server made by a popular TikTokker</a> and <a href = "https://discord.gg/swiss001" target = _blank" style="font-size:.8vw">A server
                     made by a popular YouTuber.</a> My bots/ bot features in other bots get used on average 5 times per minute in these two servers alone!. I have a custom Discord bot that you can
                      <a href = "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=733070829168099398&permissions=8&scope=bot" target = "_blank" style="font-size:.8vw">invite here too!</a> This bot can do many features 
                      from as simple as repeat a phrase to guess an images contents just by looking at it and even translate to English from any language. My bots are written in C# in the 
                      Discord.net API and are completely free to use with no paid additional features. I did this because I believe a user should get what they asked for.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!-- <h3>Other things</h3> -->
                    <br>
                    I also study networking in my free time and server management, in fact, this website is hosted on my own AWS server that I set up and configured. This is also the same server 
                    that I host my two Discord bots on, my public one available for download  <a href = "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=733070829168099398&permissions=8&scope=bot" target = "_blank" style="font-size:.8vw"> here.</a>
                    <br>
                    I also look around many other areas of computing such as hardware, how all of that works, computer history and data/cyber security. This means that I can work my way around hardware based activities and I can 
                    work my way around the internet in the most secure way possible, minimising any chance of my accounts getting compromised and if any do, then I can be sure all my other accounts are still safe and allows me to help others in the same way.
